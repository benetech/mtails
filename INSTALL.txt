Mtails build script INSTALL.txt
-------------------------------

This script will create an ISO image for Mtails, using a vanilla Tails ISO
image, downloaded from the Internet and a copy of Martus.

The script needs a Debian-based Linux system to run properly ( Debian,
Unbuntu preferred )

Requirements:

- Internet connection
- At least 2GB of free space
- apt-get
- wget
- curl
- mkisoimage

The script should be run as a non-privileged user.  If you don't give the
script any arguments, it will build a Mtails ISO imgage.  The two optiosn it
can take are:

clean:      erase working files
distclean:  erase working files and downloaded ISO images
